# Project Description
Our project is a single player RPG (Role Player Game) where the user is a human adventurer who, along their friends, gets transported into an alternate, magical universe. Each action performed by the player results in an unique outcome that will ultimately determine the fate of the characters.

Starting off, the user's first interaction will be to simply to provide their name. Throughout this journey, the user will unravel multiple, fascinating stories that will culminate in 3 alternative endings: some of course being better than others.

During their quest, the user has a multitude of options like the opportunity to obtain weapons, discover hidden routes to return home safely, or (if unfortunate enough) die if they choose the wrong option! Because there are multiple paths to the same ending, we recommend for everyone to explore all the possible options for the full experience! 

# How To Launch
To start your journey `javac Woo.java`, then `java Woo`, type in your character's name, then type the number that cooresponds with the path you would like to take to continue your customized journey.
