# Project Description
Our project is a single player RPG (Role Player Game) where the user is a human adventurer who, along their friend, gets transported into an alternate, magical universe. The first interaction the user will have is to give their name. Every interaction afterwards will involve a question which will determine the player's fate. All in all, there are 3 alternative endings, some better than others; however there are multiple ways to get to each one. On their journey, the user can obtain treasure, return home safely, or  die if they choose the wrong option! We recommend exploring all possible options for the full experience! (Ex. going up and down the mountain)
