# Project Description
 * Our project is an RPG in which the user chooses their own adventure. The user will first give their name, and then will be led on an adventure that asks them questions about what they would do to form their own unique storyline. Throughout the journey and depending on the choices the user picks, they may obtain treasure, return home safely, or even die if they choose the wrong option!
