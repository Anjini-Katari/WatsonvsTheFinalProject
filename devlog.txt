---------------------
RPG Game! Fun title is still being decided.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
 * Deciding on a topic for the final project that would 
   thoroughly demonstrate what we have learned throughout
   this semester!
 * We had an issue with static and non-static methods, and
   kept running into an issue where a non-static method 
   was invoked from a static context so we changed the methods
   in that class to static and fixed the subsequent errors and
   eventually it worked!
 * Taking user inputed data and having the computer print it
   back out at the user from different classes.
